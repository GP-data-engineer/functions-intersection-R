# functions-intersection-R
This package provides a set of R scripts to visualize and analyze the intersection points of two mathematical functions. The program incrementally evaluates function values, identifies intersections, and generates detailed plots highlighting the intersection points. It also outputs a table of computed values and stores them in a text file.
